# Dialogflow Messenger Rich Card Studio

A simple HTML page + the Dialogflow Messenger to experiment with Rich Response formats.

By default, the Dialogflow Messenger is not connected to a Dialogflow CX agent. If you would like to connect it to your agent, enable the Dialogflow Messnger Integration in your CX Agent, then rename `web/template-config.js` to `web/config.js` and set the `agentid` in the `web/config.js` to your Agent ID.
